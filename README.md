# Digital Biomarkers of Stress

This repository contains code for the article "Digital Biomarkers of Stress: An idiographic machine learning perspective on digital phenotyping". The (refactored) code for this project is run by do_study.py. This .py file starts by creating a .json file that contains a set of instructions for Python functions that perform different operations in the project (e.g., preprocessing, data splitting, model training). It then creates a directory for storing different files (data, pickled models, results, visualisations). Then, it does feature extraction, MinMax scaling, data splitting, and model training. It then goes on to calculate SHAP values, feature importance, and correlations between features and SHAP values. Finally, it creates visualisations (beeswarm plots, feature importance ranking, stacked barplot) and outputs .csv files with the numeric values that are plugged into the manuscript.
